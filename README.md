# Introduction & Difference from V1 - REDO ALL INTRO STUFF BEFORE OFFICIALLY SHARING

Welcome to **Version 2** of my ‘Efficient Ironman Route!’ After running through the 1100+ steps of[ route V1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bS9ehZ9khovZnRPoyZvaCFjAdT1_7xdiPnEj6g_Yy64/edit) – and receiving comments/suggestions from others that have run it – I’ve learned a lot, and have come back after taking a break to rebuild V2 from the ground up to be more optimized. 

There’s also been several updates since I last played almost a year ago, including the introduction of a couple low-level quests. Integrating those quests/activities and their requirements into the route changed many early steps, which worked favorably by getting higher agility levels and finishing the Ardy easy diary and other Kandarin-related steps earlier on. 

Feel free to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sU2heFY) to let me know if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions regarding the route! 

**~TheFX**


# Difference between this route and others - update this

Many efficient routes exist, though they typically focus on doing the same long skill or activity grinds for _dozens if not hundreds of hours** **_at a time to set themselves up in the **very, very long run**, primarily:



* **Wintertodt** to 85-99 Firemaking alongside significant amounts of Woodcutting, Construction, and Fletching exp, as well as [supply crates](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Supply_crate) for a myriad of supplies 
* **Agility** to ~60 for full [graceful](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Graceful_outfit)
* **Barbarian Fishing **to 99 Fishing and 77 Agility/Strength
    * Or [Tempoross](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Reward_pool)** **as a newer alternative – the “Wintertodt of fishing”
* **[Last Man Standing](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Justine%27s_stuff_for_the_Last_Shopper_Standing)** for a [rune pouch](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rune_pouch) and rune arrows to sell for vast amounts of starting gold
* **Soul Wars **to get [spoils of war](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Spoils_of_war) for cash and raw materials
* **Blackjacking** to 80 or even 91-99 for vast amounts of gold

That strategy works for many people who _know _they’ll be playing the account for many months/years to come. But, for those like me who want to experience different types of content from the very beginning, while_ still _being as efficient as possible **without burning out **from grinding the same activity for hours on end, that’s what this route is for. 


## What this route aims to achieve - Update this



* Overlap as many quest steps and diary tasks as possible to minimize backtracking
* Chain quest rewards to meet skill-level requirements for the next quest(s) to minimize the time spent grinding specific skills
    * Chain quest rewards to have enough gold for subsequent quests to minimize the time spent having to grind it
* Unlock as many teleport and travel options as early as possible to set you up for the future
* Obtain as many useful pieces of quest/activity related combat and utility gear as possible
* To overall set you up to be able to grind whatever skills need to be trained for the next quest or set of quests after there’s nothing left to chain together. 

**——**

**Note: **This route is constantly being updated and added to. Whilst running through the route myself - and from reading Discord/Youtube comments - I’ve compiled a **list of changes or missed opportunities** that could’ve been integrated early(er) on. When I get the chance, I’ll add in all the details and remove it from the list below, but for now, look into how these can fit into your route:



* I’ve been informed - though can’t verify with a source online - that the update on 2/16/22 sneakily added in the level-31 Prayer and barcrawl requirements to be able to _start_ the Scorpion Catcher in the first place, when previously you only needed those requirements right before their respective steps.
    * Will update properly soon
* [Temple of the Eye Quest](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Temple_of_the_Eye)
    * Requires Rune Mysteries, Enter the Abyss, and 10 RC (gained from EtA)
    * Rewards:
        * 1 Quest point
        * 9.12k RC exp
        * Access to the GOTR minigame for RC exp
        * A medium pouch
* I've been told that with the advent of the above quest and GOTR that you can no longer start the Enter the Abyss miniquest until you've completed Rune Mysteries, so the miniquest cannot be started after getting the iron bars from the Wildy
    * Will update when incorporating the other changes above
* According to Discord comments and wiki changes, it appears the release of Land of the Goblins may have also affected the ability to start The Lost Tribe before finishing Goblin Diplomacy.
    * Previously, you could start The Lost Tribe, then do Goblin Diplomacy in its entirety, then do The Lost Tribe step.
* The gender requirement during Recruitment Drive has been removed and replaced with a new puzzle which will test your powers of observation. In addition, players will receive 3,000 GP for completing the quest.

**——**


# Account Setup


### Suggestion - Use the Runelite game client



* The Runelite client comes with a host of Quality of Life plugins, tools, calculators, wiki and skill lookups, tile marker overlays, activity and monster hitbox outlines, a quest helper, loot tracker, menu entry swapper, etc. 
    * Open source and free - no signup needed. 
    * Officially endorsed by Jagex on the OSRS website. 


#### Only download it from Runelite.net or the OSRS website



* People have tried to spoof the site/download links to phish people’s account info, so only download it directly from [Runelite.net](https://c.tenor.com/3GD5-yS1TWwAAAAd/friends-chandler.gif), or follow the link on the left sidebar on the OSRS website. 


### Verify your email and add 2FA to increase bank space



* Always secure your account, but 2FA is also required to receive the Stronghold of Security rewards, and **increases bank space by 20. **


### Use the quest quick guides (or Quest Helper plugin)



* The document is long and text-dense already, and having every step of every quest included would greatly increase the length, so this route operates under the assumption you have the wiki quick guide open whilst doing quests, **specifically for dialogue options**.** **
    * Step-by-step instructions _are_ included whenever necessary, and in other cases you’ll see, “use the guide/quick guide to continue the quest to completion” or “up until you get X item or do Y task”.
* **Make it easy on yourself - use Runelite: **Install the Quest Helper plugin from the [plugin hub](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/). It tells you where to go, who to talk to, what items are needed, and what dialogue options to pick. 


## Important Notes on the Ironman Types 


### Hardcore Ironman

This route is equally intended for hardcore ironmen as it is standard, so **there are no suicides built into the route**, though certain steps depend on your willingness to enter the Wilderness.

Early on, there are **5 specific trips **(in order) to:



* Get iron bars for Knight’s Sword and The Giant Dwarf.
    * **Alternative: **Kill white knights in Falador.
* Start the Enter the Abyss miniquest.
    * Required to start Temple of the Eye and unlock the Guardians of the Rift minigame.
* Take the teleport lever in Edgeville to the Wilderness and then Ardougne, both for travel and to satisfy two [Achievement Diary](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Achievement_Diary) tasks **- _done twice._**
    * **Alternative: **Sail from Rimmington to Ardougne.
* Take the lever to the Wilderness to visit the Mage Bank for laws and cosmics.
    * **Alternative: **After completing Rune Mysteries, prioritize The Feud quest, then do the sudoku-like section of the Rogue Trader minigame to purchase cosmics, laws, etc. - _costs 25% more than rune shops._
        * The Runelite plugin “_Runedoku”_ has an auto-solver.


### Group Ironman (additional bank space)

While the route doesn’t specifically cater to GIMs, you can increase your bank space immensely by creating a second account to make yourself a GIM or hardcore GIM, even if you intend to play solo.



* Can trade with group members, effectively increasing your bank space by **840+ per additional member** (up to 4). 
    * **Note: **New members (fresh accounts only) can be added at any point.
* Get an additional 80 bank spaces in a shared storage, upgradeable to 200 through completing long-term tasks.
* It’s minor, but in PvP combat, group ironmen receive 1/8th the exp of PvM content, instead of the standard zero exp for all other ironmen.

If you don’t consider it against the spirit of Ironman mode, alt accounts can also be used in various situations:



* Body-block enemies to prevent melee attacks
* Hold NPC’s in place by splashing spells or locking them in dialogue
* Collect quest items or skill for raw resources, if you’re willing to play 2+ accounts simultaneously.


### Hardcore Group Ironman

For hardcore GIMs only, **there is ONE safe PvM death.** 



* Unlike _standard HCIM, **all PvM-related minigame deaths are unsafe**_ (e.g. Fight Caves, Pest Control, Chambers of Xeric, Barbarian Assault)
    * PvP minigames like Last Man Standing, Clan Wars, and Castle Wars are still safe.


# Tutorial Island

Create your character and follow the tutorial as normal. Before visiting the Magic instructor, set your Ironman status and bank pin. 



    * Setting a pin **increases bank space by 20.**
* **Note: **The previous requirement of needing to be female to win a fight during the Recruitment Drive quest has been removed and replaced with a puzzle. _You now receive 3k gp as a reward_. 

Before leaving, set and adjust your game [settings](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Settings), such as (**non-exhaustive**):



* Toggling picked-up arrows to go into your quiver vs. inventory - saves a lot of clicks and hassle
* Enabling Shift-click to drop
* Setting F Keys
    * Enabling ‘Modern Layout’ to allow F keys to also close their windows, rather than just open.
* Enabling Esc to close interfaces
* Moving follower (pet) options lower down in the menu
* Turning Accept Aid off
* Turning Player Attack options off
* Turning on tile highlights
* Turning on Hitsplat tinting
* Adjusting private/clan/game chat options
* Hiding roofs
* Adjusting camera, framerate, and draw distance


### Reference the wiki Quick Guides (or Quest Helper plugin)

The document is long and text-dense already, and having every step of every quest included would greatly increase the length, so this route operates under the assumption you can have the relevant [wiki quick guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quick_guide) open whilst doing quests, **specifically for dialogue options**.** **



* Step-by-step instructions _are_ often included, but when larger chunks of a single quest need to be done without overlap, you’ll see, “use the quick guide to continue the quest to completion” or “up until you get X item or do Y task”.


#### Make it easy on yourself with Runelite

Install the Quest Helper plugin from Runelite’s [plugin hub](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/). It tells you where to go, who to talk to, what items are needed, what dialogue options to pick, and answers to puzzles. 


# Section about what the first priority is (TT), how the route is structured to it (iron ore from kelda only, KS requiring a lot of running, etc) , and a light list of what else will be achieved on the way?


# Welcome to Lumbridge



1. Go northwest to the **ironman tutors** to get your armor - same stats as regular iron.
    * I don’t think we ever actually use it, but some people may want it just because. Probably include with an “if desired,”
2. Head to the bar and talk to **Veos **to start [X Marks the Spot](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/X_Marks_the_Spot/Quick_guide).
    * Pickpocket a nearby man/woman [(Lumbridge easy diary task)](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Lumbridge_%26_Draynor_Diary#Easy). 
3. Go west to the combat tutors.
    * **Ranged tutor: **
        * Can toggle picked-up arrows to go into your quiver instead of your inventory - saves a lot of clicks and hassle.
            * **Note: **As of 1/11/23, this option is available in **Settings**.
                * Update section.
    * **Magic tutor: **
        * Drop your airs and minds, then get 30 free wind strike casts from the tutor.
            * Can be done **every 30 minutes**, but _you cannot receive the runes_ if you have any minds or airs in your bank. 
            * **This detour is built in a handful of times because:**
                * Magic makes killing imps far less tedious.
                * 30 minds and airs have a **store value of 228gp**, which is significant this early on, and money you won’t have to spend on extra runes to level up Magic for fire strike.


### The importance of imps

[Imps ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjwwf2Rgrf8AhWKAzQIHeT-AXAQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Foldschool.runescape.wiki%2Fw%2FImp&usg=AOvVaw03B2o7kSA5oAWauwjjJc7r)can teleport, so save the majority of your strike casts to avoid wasting run energy chasing them down. They drop many useful items for quests:



* **Red, yellow, black, and white beads** - Imp Catcher
    * The primary reason you’ll be killing imps, as they are the **only source of beads.**
* **Cabbage** - Black Knights' Fortress
* **Raw chicken** - Druidic Ritual
* **Meat / Burnt meat **- Witch’s Potion
* **Egg** - Cook’s Assistant
* **Bucket of milk **- Cook’s Assistant, Gertrude’s Cat
* **Flour** - Cook’s Assistant, The Knight’s Sword, and many more
* **Cadavaberries** - Romeo & Juliet
* **Ashes **- Prince Ali Rescue and Another Cook’s Quest
* **Mind talisman** - Falador easy diary task
* **Chef’s hat **- Entrance to the Cooks’ Guild
* **Blue wizard hat** - +2 Magic att/def bonus
* **Fiendish ashes**
    * Can be scattered for 10 Prayer exp - do this whenever you get them.
    * Resource for the Demonic Offering spell on the Arceuus spellbook, which won’t be accessed for a long time.


### Regarding unpredictable drop rates

Due to the random and unpredictable nature of drops, **the route can never assume** you’ve received specific items from imps, so while there will be instances where you don’t need a certain item (e.g. milk, egg, burnt meat, cabbage), it’s still routed in to account for every scenario.


### Useful random events

In the same vein, there’s no way to predict what [random events](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Random_events) you’ll get or what useful rewards you’ll receive (coins, genie lamps, books of knowledge, arrows, runes, ore, gems, etc).



* Mysterious Old Man (not the mime show)
* Capt’ Arnav
* Niles, Miles, or Giles
* Evil Bob’s island
* Postie Pete (Evil twin)
* Genie
* Dr. Jekyll
* Pillory
* Troll pinball
* Prison Pete
* Quiz master
* Rick Turpentine
* Strange plant
* Surprise exam


#### Regarding exp lamps/books

When using these rewards on a skill, the lamp gives 10x the respective level in exp, and the book 15x. 



* If you’re lucky enough to get any very early on, **use them on Hitpoints**, as it starts at level-10 and is slow to level. You’ll eventually switch to Herblore once it gets to a high enough level.

4. Enter the general store and sell your bronze sword and wooden shield.
    * Purchase a spade for X Marks the Spot and general use.
    * Head up the ladder to pick up **5 **onions for:

        * Witch’s Potion
5. Go south to the house attached to the axe shop.

6. Run into the castle grounds toward the kitchen. 
    * If Han’s (red shirt) is close by, ask him how old your account is (easy). 
        * **Note: **He patrols around the castle. If you don’t see him, do it later.
    * In/near the kitchen, pick up:
        * Mind rune
        * Jug
        * Knife
        * Empty pot
        * Empty bowl

7. Go upstairs, then north to Duke Horacio to start [Rune Mysteries](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rune_Mysteries/Quick_guide) and get the air talisman.
    * Go to the top floor and bank everything except your knife.
        * **Note: “**Bank everything” will almost always refer to _just _your inventory and not your equipped gear, unless otherwise specified.
8. Outside the bank are **4 log spawns**, which you’ll pick up and _fletch into arrow shafts _until **854 Fletching Exp **(level-8).
    * **Note: **Tourist Trap requires level-10 Fletching (1,154 exp), which you’ll finish off with the 300-exp lamp from X Marks the Spot.
    * **Note: **This is the most popular spot for Ironmen training Firemaking for Wintertodt, so if there’s competition, try F2P worlds.
        * **If using Runelite: **By default, CTRL+SHIFT+Left or Right arrow quick-hops to the next available world (skips PvP, F2P, and specialty worlds).
    * When done, world hop 1 more time to **pick up 4 logs** for:
        * Monk’s Friend
        * The Giant Dwarf
        * Ghosts Ahoy
        * A Varrock easy diary task
    * Bank and have out:
        * Bronze dagger (equip)
        * **_All_** air and mind runes
        * Air Talisman for Rune Mysteries
9. Head east from the castle to the **church.** 
    * Talk to **Father Aereck** to start [The Restless Ghost](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Restless_Ghost/Quick_guide)
    * Go south through the **graveyard**, then southwest to the **shack**.
        * Kill a **level-3 giant rat **(5hp; level-6’s have 10hp). 
            * Keep the rat meat for Druidic Ritual.
            * Keep the **bones** for a Varrock easy diary task.
10. Continue west to the **far shack.**

        * Sea Slug
        * Horror from the Deep
        * Troll Romance
        * Eagles’ Peak
        * Tears of Guthix
        * Cold War
        * Possibly requested during Forgettable Tale
        * A spare
    * Talk to **Father Urhney **to get the amulet of ghostspeak for several quests involving ghosts.
        * **Drop** the amulet and _ask for anothe_r to get a spare - called _“[drop tricking](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Drop_trick).”_


# Ferox Enclave / The Wilderness



11. Grouping teleport -> Clan Wars (area is called Ferox Enclave) -> run west into the [white portal](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Free-for-all_portal) to restore run energy, HP, Prayer, and any skill reductions. 
        * **Note: **The [Pool of Refreshment](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pool_of_Refreshment) in the north building does the same, but it’s further away from the bank chest _and _locks you into an animation. 
    * Deposit _everything_ at the bank chest and have out:
        * Bread
        * Shrimps
    * **_Hop to an F2P world to avoid potential PKers._**
12. Northwest of the enclave is an iron bar spawn near some bears ([map location](https://imgur.com/a/5PemjSB)).
    * Pick up **3 iron bars** for - _world hop each time as it has a long respawn timer. _
        * The Knight’s Sword (2)
        * The Giant Dwarf
    * Return to Ferox Enclave, restore run energy, then bank to have out:
        * Amulet of ghostspeak (equip)
        * All mind and air runes
        * Spade
        * Mysterious orb for X Marks the Spot


# Lumbridge / Stronghold of Security



13. Home teleport to Lumbridge and go to the Magic tutor to get another set of starter runes.
    * **Recall this is built in a handful of times because:**
        * Magic makes killing imps far less tedious.
        * 30 minds and airs have a **store value of 228gp**, which is significant this early on, and money you won’t have to spend on extra runes to level up Magic for fire strike.


### Aside - Fire Strike

Fire strike only requires level-13 Magic and can **hit a max of 8**. It’ll be your bread and butter attack for a long time because:



* It’s cost-efficient - 12gp per cast if using a fire staff (2 airs, 1 mind).
* Most standard enemies have low or no Magic levels and zero or even negative magic defense, meaning you don’t need any magic gear to hit accurately.
* Melee and Ranged cannot compete in damage for some time:
    * **For melee: **You’d need **level-42 Strength** and an Adamant scimitar (28 strength bonus) to hit an 8.
    * **For ranged: **You’d need **level-48 Ranged** and a Maple shortbow with mithril arrows (22 ranged strength bonus) to hit an 8.

—



14. Head to the **graveyard** ghost and talk to him with the amulet of ghostspeak equipped.
    * Talk to Count Check nearby to get teleported to the [Stronghold of Security](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Stronghold_of_Security).
    * Head to the surface and go north into the longhall to:
        * Pick up 3 beers for Prince Ali Rescue
        * Pick up **10+ meat_ _**(heals 3hp) to use throughout the stronghold. 
            * **Note: **You can be **hit up to 5 on Floor 2 **and **up to 7 on Floor 3**, so you’ll likely need to eat every time you take damage on those floors.
15. Head back into the Stronghold.
    * Follow the tunnels to the **center** of each floor to get **10k gp** from the **third floor **chest. 
        * _Reference the [floorplans](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/6/63/Stronghold_of_Security_map.png/450px-Stronghold_of_Security_map.png?4f1c7) if you need help navigating._
    * **Note: **’Entering the second level’ is a Varrock easy diary task, but despite getting the 10k gp, it didn’t scratch it off in my log during V2, so verify that it does.


# Draynor / Wizard’s Tower



16. Once you get the 10k gp, use the portals to get to the surface, then run south to the **northeast** **quest icon **in **Draynor.**
    * Talk to **Morgan** to start [Vampyre Slayer](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Vampyre_Slayer/Quick_guide), then go upstairs to the _west_ cupboard and take **5 garlic **for:

17. Head southwest into the market.
    * Dig in the [middle of the pig pen](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/2/2d/X_Marks_the_Spot_-_fourth_clue.png/240px-X_Marks_the_Spot_-_fourth_clue.png?912e1) to get the ancient casket for X Marks the Spot 
    * From **Diango**, purchase:
        * [Chronicle](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chronicle) (300gp)
            * **Note: **Teleports you to the [Champions’ Guild](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Champions%27_Guild) outside of Varrock, allowing quick access to the city before obtaining law runes.
        * **3** teleport cards (150gp ea)

18. Bank everything _except your coins._

### Sources of early Farming experience

**TL;DR: **You’ll plant crops and make supercompost to get the final** ~1,000 Farming exp** to be able to do [Forgettable Tale](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Forgettable_Tale...)**.**

—

An early goal for the route is unlocking the [Fairy Ring](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fairy_rings) transportation system, which requires completing Fairy Tale Pt 1 and part of Pt 2. 



* During Pt 1 you fight the [Tanglefoot](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tanglefoot), and the higher Farming level you have, the easier the fight is. 
    * **Forgettable Tale** rewards 5k Farming exp, but requires **level-17** (3,115 exp) during the quest.
* You’ll purchase _cider_ when in Hosidius (+1 Farming boost), so you only need **level-16** (2,746 exp), but you’ll likely reach level-17 anyway.

You’ll need to manually farm **~1000 Farming exp** while gaining the other _~2,000_ from:



* **50-200** - Getting 0-5% Hosidius favor
* **800** - Getting 5-45% Hosidius favor
* **1,000** - RFD: Goblin Generals

Seeds are very cheap, exp drops are large, and you’ll conveniently pass by many patches along the route, streamlining the process.



* Applying supercompost to patches yields 26 exp
    * Pineapples cost 5gp at charter ships - _15 required for compost bins_
* Harvesting the lowest level crops yields:
    * Marigolds - 55.5 exp
        * _Protects potatoes and onions from disease_
    * Potato - 98 exp
    * Onion - 114.5 exp
    * Rosemary - 78.5 exp
        * _Protects cabbage from disease_
    * Cabbage - 125 exp

#### Important Farming notes



* Use crops on the tool leprechaun to note them.
* You can still compost after planting a crop.
* When harvesting, double-click (or just spam-click) the patch **during the first 2 exp drops** to harvest much faster than normal.
* Crops grow in stages (called [growth ticks](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Farming#Growth_timing)), and logging in or out at certain times can disrupt them.
    * **Note: **This should **NOT **affect the route.
* **Watering **crops reduces the chance for disease for a single growth tick.
    * However, growth ticks range from every _5 minutes _to _11 hours_, and the number of stages per crop ranges from _4 to 12_, so it’s a waste of time.

## Kittens & Cats

**TL;DR: **You’ll raise kittens until they turn into cats (3 hrs in-game) so you can trade them for death runes.


#### Why raise a kitten

Once a kitten has grown into a cat, you can trade it to a [Civilian](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Civilian) in West Ardougne for **100 death runes **after completing Plague City. 



* After completing the first tier of the Ardougne easy diary, you’ll get **200.** 
* **Note: **It’ll take some time to get the level-41 Magic needed to use death runes for blast spells, so you’ll be selling the first few hundred for early cash.
    * Your stockpile will still be a few thousand strong by the time you begin using them. 

**Note: **There’s a **“kitten-tracker” **Runelite plugin that monitors the following info and notifies you when you need to take action. 



* Sometimes the numbers lag behind after logging out or hopping worlds, so you can also go into settings and increase the visibility of alert messages in your chat box:
    * _Chat Notifications > Highlight words "hungry,attention" and check ‘Notify on highlight’y_


### Growth

It takes **3 hours of playtime** to raise a [kitten](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kitten#Caring_for_a_kitten) into a cat, when it will no longer require food or attention. 

**If membership lapses** while your kitten/cat is on the ground, **it will disappear,** and you’ll have to pay Gertrude 100gp for a new one.


### Hunger

I won’t list _every_ time you go to a bank or prepare for a quest, but as a general rule, if your kitten is out, **have something to feed it. **



* Eventually, you’ll have a stackable source of [karambwanji](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Raw_karambwanji) to make it easier.

Every **24 minutes**, the kitten will say it’s hungry. 



* 3 mins later it’ll say it’s _really _hungry. 
* 3 mins after that it will **run away**.
    * Feeding it resets the timer to 24 minutes. 


### Attention

Every **25 minutes**, it’ll cry for attention. 



* 7 mins later it’ll do it again.
* 7 mins later it will **run away**.

Attending to it will reset the timer to 18 mins.



* Doing it again will reset it to 25 mins. 
* Using a _ball of wool_ doubles the time to **50 minutes.**

## Agility & restoring run energy

The #1 reason why Tourist Trap is prioritized so early is because [run energy restoration](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Agility#Run_energy_restoration) is determined by Agility level. 

Due to how it’s calculated, you only gain an increase to the restore rate **every 5 Agility levels **(e.g 0-5, 6-11), gaining **_7-8% of an increase_** with each breakpoint.



* **At level-1**, it takes _7.5 seconds_ to restore 1% energy
    * 12:30 from 0-100%
* **At level-26**, it now takes _5 seconds_ - **33% faster!**
    * 8:20 from 0-100%
* **At level-99**, it takes _2.5 seconds_ - only _100% faster_, despite a vast 73-level difference
    * 4:10 from 0-100%


#### Run energy does not restore while:



* Running
* Crossing an Agility obstacle
* Flying on a[ Magic carpet](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Magic_carpet) in the desert
* Logged out

### 0-20% Arceuus Favor

You need **20% Arceuus favor** to start The Ascent of Arceuus. Each book rewards **2.5% **Arceuus favor, so you’ll need to turn in **8 books **(one at a time), rewarding you with **8 **[Books of Arcane Knowledge](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Book_of_arcane_knowledge), which can give either:



* Runecraft exp (Level x 4) - _a pitiful 4 exp per book at the moment_
* Magic exp (Level x 11)
    * **_USE ALL BOOKS ON MAGIC_**


#### The quick and easy method (Runelite)

The **_“Kourend Library”_** plugin shows you exactly where to go for the book you want, _and _highlights other book locations so you can pick them up preemptively. 

**Note: **There are only **2 books per room **until the library resets (every 80-100 mins), so even if the plugin says there’s more, you can’t take them if you’ve already taken two.


#### The (improved) standard method

**If you don’t use Runelite:** 



* You have to check bookshelves manually, but [Biblia](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Biblia)** **on the **top floor** can tell you which section it’s in. 
* Fortunately, [Woox](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5dyn-al6BeNzoaoJGV6zKA) created a handy [webtool](https://wooxsolo.github.io/KourendLibrary/index.html) and [how-to guide](https://github.com/WooxSolo/KourendLibrary) for finding books quickly, based on u/evonaabi’s [findings](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/7k06nd/king_of_the_skill_wrongful_disqualification/). 

**How-to summary: **



* Search bookshelves to find **any book**, which you’ll _keep_ for other patrons.
* On the webtool, _click _the corresponding bookshelf (**red dot**) on the floor you found it on.
    * _Click _on the book’s title in the right box.
* **Yellow dots** will populate the floors to indicate _possible _book locations, although not necessarily the one you’re asked to find - **_keep all books _**for other patrons.
    * The first couple locations may not have a book, but once you find and map one, the webtool will update - **max of 2 books per room.**
    * **Note: **The top floor’s **southwest **corner apparently has weird mechanics and doesn’t provide as much information.
* Book locations change every **80-100 minutes**.
    * If the webtool becomes inaccurate, the locations likely reset, so manually check bookshelves until you find the next book.
        * _Reload the webtool_ and input the new location.


#### Special books



* If you find **_Transportation Incantations_**:
    * Read it to unlock the [Kourend Teleport](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kourend_Castle_Teleport) spell (level-69 Magic) on the standard spellbook. 
* If you find **_Soul Journey_**:
    * Read it to start the [Bear Your Soul](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bear_Your_Soul/Quick_guide) miniquest, which won’t be done for a long time.

#### Sulphurous Fertilizer methods


##### **Slow but automatic**



* Have out:
    * 14 buckets of compost
    * 14 saltpeter
* _Combine them _and wait out the automatic process.


##### **Faster but click-intensive**

You can speed up the process by **_manually combining _**the items to skip the animation.



* However, it uses the ones you select vs. starting at the beginning (like with fletching, cooking food, cutting gems), so it involves a lot of clicking and mouse movement. 
* At the bank:
    * _Right-Click _-> **Set-X** -> 7
    * Withdraw-7** _saltpeter_**
        * Withdraw-7 _compost_
            * Withdraw-7 _saltpeter_
                * Withdraw-7 _compost_
* Combine in groups to minimize distance between items.


##### **Fastest, still click-intensive (Runelite)**

Runelite has a **_“menu entry swapper”_** plugin that can turn ‘Withdraw X’ into a _left-click action_.



* Right-Click -> **Set-X** -> 7
* Click _saltpeter_
    * Click _compost_
        * Click _saltpeter_
            * Click _compost_
* Combine in groups to minimize distance between items.

### Pie-making strategy (&lt;25 Cooking)

Open the [overhead map](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Mess_guide.png?9a222) to see which numbers reference which cupboards (also directionally labeled below).



* **Take-X** -> 14 _flour_ from cupboard 1 (**south **wall)
* **Take-50** _bowls_ from cupboard 2 (**southwest **wall)
    * Fill the bowls at sink 3 (**northwest **wall)
* Return to **cupboard 2 **and combine_ flour + water_ -> **pastry dough**
    * _Wait out the automatic process_
    * _Use _the **empty bowl** -> **cupboard 2** to deposit them all
* **Take-50** _pie shells_ from cupboard 2
    * Put a **pastry dough** and **pie shell** in the **bottom-right corner** of your inventory, then repeatedly _use _one on the other to quickly combine them.+
        * _It will do it automatically, but it’s significantly slower. _
* **Take-50** _meat_ from table 4 (**north **wall)
    * Cook the meat at range 5 (**east **wall) - _get more if too many burn_
        * **Note: **If **&lt;33% burn**, _don’t _get more, just _move on_ to keep up the pace. 
    * **Drop** all burnt meat.
* _Use_ meat -> pastry dough using the same _quick-click_ method.
    * **Cook** the pies at **range 5**
* Use pies -> buffet table 6 (**west room**) to get favor and exp.
    * **Drop** remaining items as you run back to **cupboard 1.**

Note in the **top-left corner **how the _appreciation bars_ change - _the lower the bar, the lower the favor and exp reward._



* **Hop **to the **first **world where the appreciation bars are either:
    * Equal
    * Pie > stew/pizza
        * Only happens if someone else made a different type of food.

**Repeat the process **until you get **~2,800 Cooking exp **(level-25).



* Switch to** stews** - you may burn more, but they’re faster to make _and_ require less steps. 


### Stew-making strategy (25+ Cooking)

Open the [overhead reference map](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Mess_guide.png?9a222), if needed.



* **Take-X **-> 14 _potatoes_ from cupboard** 1**
* **Take-50** _bowls_ from cupboard **2 **
    * Fill the bowls at sink** 3**
        * _Combine** **_the **potatoes** +_ **bowls of water** _using the _quick-click_ method.
* **Take-50** meat from table** 4**
    * **Cook** the meat at range** 5**
* _Combine **meat**_ + **uncooked stew_ _**using the quick-click method.
    * **Cook **the stews at range** 5**
* _Use _stews -> buffet table **6**. 
    * **Drop** remaining items as you run back to **cupboard 1.**

**World hop **to reset the appreciation bars, then **repeat **until you reach 90% Hosidius favor, gaining **~11,500 Cooking exp** (level-33).


### The importance of 100% Hosidius favor

Reaching 100% Hosidius Favor unlocks the range in the Hosidius Kitchens, which provides an extra **5% success chance **when cooking - _incredibly important _for cooking the **ONE **karambwan given during Tai Bwo Wannai Trio.

Burning it** **means you need to grind **450k Fishing exp **(level-65) to get another one to continue the quest.



* You can boost from level-60 (**275k exp)** with a spicy stew, but that’s still a significant grind.

You’ll hold off on _attempting_ to cook the karambwan until _at least **level-48 Cooking**_, since using the range at that level gives a [2/3 chance of success](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Cooked_karambwan#Cooking_chance).



* If using a +5 **spicy stew** (post RFD: Evil Dave), it can be boosted to 70.3%.


#### Hosidius favor rewards



* 15% - Steal from fruit stalls
* 35% - Can plant a spirit tree near the Forthos ruins (level-83 Farming)
* 50% - Farming patches are permanently protected from disease
* 60% - Able to enter the Farming Guild (level-45 Farming)
* 65% - Can plant grape seeds in the Vinery (level-36 Farming)
* 75% - Able to enter the Woodcutting Guild (level-60 Woodcutting)
* 100% - Access to the Tithe Farm minigame (level-34/54/74 Farming)
* 100% - Access to the Hosidius Kitchens’ range (+5% success chance when cooking)

### Icthlarin’s Little Helper notes

When inside the pyramid, _Spam-click _the **minimap **to automatically avoid traps and path around scarabs.

You have to **jump across a pit** several times. 



* Requires 20%+ energy, which will be drained, but having **high run energy **increases the chance of success.
* _Unequipping your weapon/shield slots_ **further **increases the chance of success.

During the** guardian fight: **



* Use earth bolt to deal more damage.
* You’ll fight 1 of 4 possible enemies - _2 magic, 2 melee. _
    * **If melee:** safespot them over the table in the middle of the room.
    * **If mage:** Can you safespot from max distance like you can during the priest fight?

During the **possessed priest fight:**



* Use earth bolt to deal more damage.
* **Safespot: **their magic attack only has a **5-tile **range (players have 10), so mage them _over the table_ from far enough away.
* The guardian drops 1 of 5 random potions - if it’s an **agility potion (4)**, keep it for Tai Bwo Wannai Trio.

### Reaching the next run restore breakpoint

**Level-42 Agility** is the next run restore breakpoint - **_6.9% faster_**



* Level-40 - 4.286 seconds per 1% energy
    * **7:09** from 0-100%
* Level-42 - 4 seconds per 1%
    * **6:40** from 0-100% - **_29 seconds faster_**

The Canifis rooftop course has a **19,700 exp/hr **rate, however the wiki states _as low as_ **5,000 exp/hr **is common until level-50 Agility, due to failing obstacles. 



* Finishing the lap gives the majority of the exp, and unfortunately there’s a failable obstacle right before the end.

You need **~8,300 Agility exp** to get to level-42 Agility. 



* Ideally, it will take **_&lt;45 mins_**, but at the wiki’s rate, it could take **~_1.5 hours_** - I’ll start the grind and report back to see if it's worth it. Would be the last breakpoint reached for some time (30k exp away from level-47), unless pursuing graceful (below).


#### Many prefer to obtain full Graceful ASAP

While rings of dueling help circumvent some early energy issues, many people rush the Canifis course to grind out enough Marks of Grace for [full graceful](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Graceful_outfit#Obtaining) (~level-56 Agility) _and/or _until **level-60 Agility **to unlock the Seers’ Village rooftop course.

### Getting a better melee weapon

You’re reaching the point where you’ll need to melee certain enemies and quest bosses. While the adamant scimitar from The Feud is decent, there’s a few quickly and/or easily acquirable upgrades.



* A **rune scimitar** is still the** **gold standard, but after the April 2021 update that made maces and spears 4-tick weapons like scimitars, there’s a few options to compare.


#### Comparing the four best rune weapons


##### Highlights


    **Scimitar** - Objectively best, but has a 2% drop rate - _1 more max hit than sword_


    **Sword**  - Bought for **20.8k**, has _additional versatility_



* Scimitar is effectively slash only (+7 stab), while the sword has a decent slash bonus (+26) if you need to swap combat styles.
        * Also, the next few quest bosses are weaker to stab than slash.

    **Mace **- A cheap **14.4k** - **_1-2 lower max hit than the others_**


    **Spear** - Equally effective at all attack styles, but exp is equally split across Att/Str/Def

* Obtained from finishing Tai Bwo Wannai Trio.

#### In summary

The **mace** is too weak and the **spear** isn’t worth the time and effort to obtain.

The **scimitar** and **sword** are effectively**_ _on-par _at this Strength level_**.



* Due to the scimitar’s extra +6 Strength bonus, it will gain +1 max hit before the sword will, so if you decide to use potions or Prayer, you’ll gain a decent DPS increase.
    * e.g.) At level-52 Strength, the scimitar can hit 13 but the sword stays at 12 - **_8.2% more DPS._**

**In short: **The sword is quicker to acquire, but the scimitar is objectively stronger.



* _Dealer’s choice _on whether the **1/50** drop chance is worth it, or if you want to move on after getting **20.8k** worth of loot.


##### Next steps towards level-60 Attack

You gain **~98k** total Attack exp (level-49) from quests alone before you begin the grind to level-60 for [Dragon](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_equipment#One-handed_melee_weapons) weapons. 



* Including combat exp gained along the way, you should be around **~level-52 Attack** by then - Using 125k exp for calcs - too generous?

Level-60 Attack will be **149k **experience away.

Some of that will be done at chaos druids to get herbs for potions, but the majority of it may be obtained from either:



* Killing ammonite crabs to get fossils for the Museum for kudos and exp
* [Tackling organized crime](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tackle_organised_crime) in Shayzien for training manuals.
    * _From levels 52-59,_ you’ll receive an average of 1,161.625 exp per manual, so you’ll need **~130 manuals **to get to level-60 Attack.
    * However, that doesn’t include any combat exp gained from fighting the gangs, _and _you can receive _multiple manuals per gang_ tackled. 
        * In the end, you’d likely only need** half the amount **of manuals**.**

#### Flinching - combat mechanic

You can defeat Elvarg (80hp, max hit of 10) without taking damage by using the [flinch](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Flinching) mechanic.



* **Simply put:**
    * Activate your quick-prayers
    * Attack
    * Run **behind the torch** while turning off your quick-prayers
    * Wait for the health bar to disappear.
    * Repeat until dead

Flinching has a timer influenced by the monster’s attack speed (tick delay = attackspeed/2), followed by an 8-tick (4.8 sec) _“in-combat_” timer once you leave their attack range.



* **Note: **Health bars disappear when the combat timer ends, which is your cue to attack again.

        * Kharedst’s memoirs
        * Iron gloves
        * Boots of lightness
            * _Swap with climbing boots during melee combat_
    * Coins
    * Strike runes
    * Fire staff
    * Climbing boots
    * Holy Grail items:
        * Excalibur
        * Magic whistle

    * You now have to kill the **Black Knight Titan** (142 hp, max hit of 15).
        * **Note: **Use your rune weapon for the majority of the fight, but **KILL HIM WITH EXCALIBUR**, or he will_ heal to full hp._


#### Flinching the Black Knight Titan

Like Elvarg, you can defeat the Black Knight Titan using the [flinch](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Flinching) mechanic, but _with a slight difference. _



* **Simply put:**
    * Attack the titan
    * Step back
    * Immediately attack again - **_no need to wait for health bar to disappear_**
    * Repeat

Recall flinching has the _attack speed delay timer_ + _in-combat timer_, which influences how long you have to wait to attack them again. 



* However, the Black Knight Titan is **immobile**, so moving even 1 square away _resets the timer_, allowing you to flinch as fast as your weapon allows. 

**Note: **You can pray **_Superhuman Strength_ **and **_Improved Reflexes_ **to boost Attack and Strength by 10% when active.



* Either set your **_quick-prayers _**(right-click orb on map) to either [flick](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Prayer#Prayer_flicking) them on-and-off when you hit to save Prayer Points, or just keep them on until they drain naturally to avoid a bunch of intensive clicking.

* With a +5 **spicy stew** (post RFD: Evil Dave), it can be boosted to **70.3%.**

Recall that you only get **ONE **free karambwan during Tai Bwo Wannai Trio. Burning it** **means you need **level-65 Fishing **to get another one to continue the quest.



* Level-65 Fishing is **450k **xp.
    * You can boost from level-60 with a spicy stew (62 w/ fish pie), but that’s still **275k **exp away - **~7.8** hours of fly fishing, not including banking.


#### Why it’s important

Karambwan heal **18** and have a unique effect if [combo-eaten](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Food%2FFast_foods#Combo_Eating) directly after eating a _different_ piece of food, allowing you to recover health much faster ([video reference](https://youtu.be/KBnlGZXQdLc?t=582)).



* If you **DON’T **burn it:
    * You can finish the quest and buy raw karambwan -> use [Rionasta’s](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rionasta) parcel service to bank them -> cook in Hosidius for the extra 5% success chance.
* If you **DO** burn it:
    * The only source of karambwan is the Brimhaven food shop _- **325gp **ea._

Finishing Making History starts [The Enchanted Key](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Enchanted_Key) miniquest, where you can hunt down **11 treasure sites **for a small amount of decent loot, namely law runes.

* Wiki says “...random order per player, **_but the locations stay the same_**” so, since we know the locations, can you dig without having to go in order?
    * If so, we can only go for the locations we want for the law runes and ore.
        * **I will test it and update this section**
    * If not, I’ll have to make a note, “If your key location is XYZ.,” …though I’ll probably forget to circle back and add every one of these in the route.

    * **DO THIS WHEN CONTINUING ONE SMALL FAVOUR.**

Go north to **Sbott** and tan a cowhide into **hard leather** (easy) for Animal Magnetism.



    * Removed from section where we buy the shark for Fremmy Trials, since IIRC we couldn’t have started animal mag yet anyway, and we’ll be back in Canifis to continue Ghosts Ahoy.

Bank and have out:

            * STILL NEED TO SMELT THEM AFTER CHANGES
                * Should probably smelt **8+** extra steel bars for Mahogany Homes contracts

        * ~~Steel longsword~~
        * ~~2 steel swords~~

    * Shilo Village

    * Probably shouldn’t continue it until coming back with the Karambwan (if we get it). 

—



* Zeah portion - postponed for a while, likely until needing to get the spear for Tai Bwo Wannai Trio.
    * Easy diary requires
        * 25 con & 8.75k
            * Doubt we’ve had enough planks or opportunities to do MH contracts to get 25 by now
        * Limpwurt to make a strength potion
    * Finish Ascent of Arc
    * Mt Karuulm section
    * Worth doing the Shayzien section now?
        * Would be great to get 2x the drop chance on xeric’s tally before fighting lizardmen, even though it’s still 1/125 (vs 1/250)
* **wHEN WE DO GO, **Fairy ring to Zeah to:
    * Continue Ascent of Arceuus
    * Finish the easy diary to get the 2x xeric’s tally drop rate
        * Need tarromin + limpwurt root to make a str pot in lova bar
        * Need **25 Con **to move house to Hosi
            * Worth doing this **- prob not - **or skip having the 2x tally drop rate and just do it later? Goes from 1/250 to 1/125, and you have to kill 150 lizardmen to get from 5-20% (.1% per kill), so it’s not _super _unlikely to get it when getting 20% Shayzien favor
                    * Side note, 150 will take a long time to kill. Worth doing more medpacks and less lizardmen? 
            * Tales of the Righteous has been pushed back and isn’t as valuable now
                * 8k gp, 10% shayz favor, teleport page
    * Shayzien intro + favor + Tales of the Righteous?
        * Tales isn’t super helpful since it’s been pushed further back, but does give the teleport page. 
    *
